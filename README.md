"# VehicleManager_RESTful-APIs" 
This is an assigned coursework for OOP module where we need to have Vehicle_Rental System. Front-end is done by ReactJS, I chose ReactJS,cause I didn't know it until I started this project (I'm from Angular background and wanted to learn something out of box). Back-end is done using Springboot by connecting MongoDB. Basically there is a console application where Manager can perform CRUD on Vehicles and User can book a vehicle for Rent.
